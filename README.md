# PH Find Solution Shortcode

This was a front-end project for a client's WordPress site. Based on their requirements, I made the shortode in find-solution.php

For the purposes of Github, I moved the CSS and js to one file.

The shortcode helps a customer find the ideal solution to problems they may have. The shortcode accepts a parameter for id, which is used to return the shortcode of a form plugin.

The output is broken down into 3 parts (or steps):
1. a section where the customer can check off what problems they are facing
2. based on problems checked off, solutions are shown. They can learn more about the solutions or link to a form
3. the checked off problems in step 1 are repeated and the shortcode for a form is rendered

Note: depending on your theme setup, JS and CSS may need tweaking to work properly.
